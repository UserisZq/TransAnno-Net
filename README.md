The workflow of this study is divided into four main steps: data preparation, data pre-processing, model pre-training and fine-tuning specific to the cell type annotation task, and performance evaluation. In the first step, data from different sources are merged into a unified file, and in the second step, the model receives the gene expression matrix of the scRNA-seq data as input and preprocesses the data using SCANPY, which includes filtering of low-quality cells, normalization, as well as log transformations and selection of highly-variable genes. In the third step, TransAnno-Net is pre-trained on an unlabeled large-scale scRNA-seq dataset to identify potential features of cell type representations, which helps to eliminate batch effects between datasets. It is then fine-tuned on several specific, manually labeled target datasets. Finally, the model performance is thoroughly evaluated to verify the usability and generalizability ability of the model.

(B) Preprocessing of gene expression matrix data for quality control, normalization, and selection of highly variable genes. (C) The preprocessed data are fed into TransAnno-Net for embedding representation and classification of cell types. The training process of TransAnno-Net consists of two stages: self-supervised learning on unlabeled data to obtain a pre-trained model, and supervised learning on a cell type-specific labeling task to obtain a fine-tuned model.
