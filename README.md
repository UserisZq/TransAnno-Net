The workflow of this study is divided into four main steps: data preparation, data pre-processing, model pre-training and fine-tuning specific to the cell type annotation task, and performance evaluation. In the first step, data from different sources are merged into a unified file, and in the second step, the model receives the gene expression matrix of the scRNA-seq data as input and preprocesses the data using SCANPY, which includes filtering of low-quality cells, normalization, as well as log transformations and selection of highly-variable genes. In the third step, TransAnno-Net is pre-trained on an unlabeled large-scale scRNA-seq dataset to identify potential features of cell type representations, which helps to eliminate batch effects between datasets. It is then fine-tuned on several specific, manually labeled target datasets. Finally, the model performance is thoroughly evaluated to verify the usability and generalizability ability of the model.
